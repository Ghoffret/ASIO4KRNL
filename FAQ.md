# ASIO4KRNL Frequently Asked Questions

**Common questions and solutions for ASIO4KRNL users**

## General Questions

### What is ASIO4KRNL?
ASIO4KRNL is a professional audio driver for Windows that provides ultra-low latency access to USB audio interfaces. Unlike generic Windows drivers, ASIO4KRNL operates at the kernel level for maximum performance and minimal latency.

### How is ASIO4KRNL different from ASIO4ALL?
- **ASIO4KRNL**: True kernel-mode driver that communicates directly with hardware
- **ASIO4ALL**: User-mode wrapper around existing Windows audio APIs
- **Performance**: ASIO4KRNL typically achieves 3-8ms latency vs 8-15ms for ASIO4ALL
- **Stability**: Kernel-mode operation provides superior reliability and fewer dropouts

### Is ASIO4KRNL free to use?
Yes, ASIO4KRNL is open source and completely free for personal and commercial use.

### What audio interfaces are supported?
ASIO4KRNL works with USB Audio Class devices including:
- Focusrite Scarlett series
- PreSonus AudioBox series  
- Behringer U-PHORIA series
- MOTU M series
- Most USB microphones and audio interfaces

See our [Device Compatibility Guide](DEVICE_COMPATIBILITY.md) for a complete list.

## Installation and Setup

### Do I need to uninstall ASIO4ALL before installing ASIO4KRNL?
No, both drivers can coexist on the same system. However, only use one at a time in your audio applications.

### Why does installation require administrator privileges?
ASIO4KRNL installs a kernel-mode driver, which requires administrator access to modify system files and register the driver with Windows.

### Can I install ASIO4KRNL on Windows 10/11?
Yes, ASIO4KRNL is designed for Windows 10 and Windows 11 (64-bit only). Windows 7/8 are not supported.

### My antivirus software blocked the installation. Is this safe?
This can happen because ASIO4KRNL includes a kernel driver. The software is completely safe - temporarily disable your antivirus during installation if needed.

### How do I uninstall ASIO4KRNL?
Use Windows Settings → Apps → ASIO4KRNL → Uninstall, or use "Programs and Features" in Control Panel. The uninstaller removes all components cleanly.

## Configuration and Usage

### What buffer size should I use?
- **64-128 samples**: For live recording and real-time monitoring (requires powerful system)
- **256 samples**: Good balance for most users (recommended starting point)
- **512-1024 samples**: For mixing, mastering, or older computers
- **2048+ samples**: Only for systems with performance limitations

### What sample rate is best?
- **44.1 kHz**: CD quality, good for most work
- **48 kHz**: Professional standard (recommended)
- **88.2/96 kHz**: High quality for critical listening
- **176.4/192 kHz**: Maximum quality (high CPU usage)

### Should I enable Low Latency Mode?
Enable it for:
- Live recording sessions
- Real-time virtual instruments
- Performance where every millisecond matters

Disable it for:
- Mixing and mastering
- Systems with limited CPU power
- When stability is more important than ultra-low latency

### My DAW doesn't show ASIO4KRNL as an option. What's wrong?
1. Restart your DAW after installing ASIO4KRNL
2. Ensure both DAW and ASIO4KRNL are 64-bit
3. Check that ASIO4KRNL service is running in Windows Services
4. Verify your DAW supports ASIO drivers

### How do I know if ASIO4KRNL is working properly?
Look for:
- Green status indicators in the control panel
- Low latency readings (under 10ms for most setups)
- Zero underruns during normal operation
- Clean audio without clicks, pops, or dropouts

## Performance and Troubleshooting

### I'm getting audio dropouts. How do I fix this?
1. **Increase buffer size** to 512 or 1024 samples
2. **Close unnecessary programs** to free up CPU
3. **Use a different USB port** (preferably USB 2.0)
4. **Disable Windows audio enhancements** for your device
5. **Check USB cable quality** - poor cables cause dropouts

### My audio interface isn't detected by ASIO4KRNL
1. **Install manufacturer drivers first** (some devices require this)
2. **Try different USB ports** on your computer
3. **Check Windows Device Manager** for hardware errors
4. **Update device firmware** if available
5. **Test with a different USB cable**

### Latency is higher than expected
1. **Reduce buffer size** gradually until you find the limit
2. **Disable Low Latency Mode** if it's causing instability
3. **Check for extra buffering** in your DAW settings
4. **Disable Windows audio effects** and enhancements
5. **Ensure Windows is in high-performance power mode**

### Can I use multiple audio interfaces simultaneously?
ASIO4KRNL supports one primary interface at a time. For multiple interfaces, you'll need audio software that supports multiple ASIO drivers or use ASIO4ALL as a wrapper.

### Why does my system slow down when using ASIO4KRNL?
- **Lower buffer sizes require more CPU** - try increasing buffer size
- **High sample rates use more processing power** - reduce sample rate if possible
- **Other applications competing for resources** - close unnecessary programs
- **System not optimized for audio** - follow our performance optimization guide

## DAW-Specific Questions

### FL Studio shows high latency despite low buffer settings
FL Studio adds its own buffering. Check:
1. **FL Studio's buffer length** settings match ASIO4KRNL
2. **Disable "Triple buffer"** in FL Studio audio settings
3. **Set mixing buffer** to minimum in FL Studio

### REAPER doesn't respond to buffer size changes
1. **Restart REAPER** after changing ASIO4KRNL settings
2. **Check REAPER's device settings** aren't overriding ASIO settings
3. **Disable REAPER's anticipative processing** if enabled

### Pro Tools won't recognize ASIO4KRNL
Pro Tools may require specific ASIO driver certification. Try:
1. **Using compatibility mode** in Pro Tools
2. **Checking Avid's approved driver list**
3. **Using ASIO4ALL as an alternative** for Pro Tools

### Ableton Live has sync issues with ASIO4KRNL
1. **Ensure sample rates match** between Ableton and ASIO4KRNL
2. **Disable Ableton's audio enhancement features**
3. **Check clock source settings** in Ableton's audio preferences

## Advanced Configuration

### Can I adjust driver settings beyond the GUI?
The GUI provides access to all user-configurable settings. Advanced registry tweaks are possible but not recommended for most users.

### How do I optimize Windows for audio production?
1. **Use high-performance power plan**
2. **Disable Windows audio enhancements**
3. **Turn off system notifications during sessions**
4. **Close unnecessary background services**
5. **Disable Windows Defender real-time scanning for audio folders**

### Can I use ASIO4KRNL with virtual machines?
USB audio devices in virtual machines can be problematic. ASIO4KRNL is designed for native Windows installations and may not work reliably in VM environments.

### Does ASIO4KRNL support surround sound?
ASIO4KRNL supports multiple channels as provided by your audio interface. Surround sound depends on your hardware capabilities and channel configuration.
