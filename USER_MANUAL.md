## Overview

ASIO4KRNL is a professional audio driver that provides ultra-low latency access to your audio interface. Unlike generic Windows drivers, ASIO4KRNL operates at the kernel level for maximum performance and stability.

### Key Benefits
- **Ultra-low latency**: Achieve 3-8ms roundtrip latency
- **Exceptional stability**: Kernel-mode operation prevents dropouts
- **Professional compatibility**: Works with all major DAWs
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live performance metrics and status

### How It Works
ASIO4KRNL bypasses the Windows audio stack and communicates directly with your USB audio interface using kernel-mode drivers. This eliminates the overhead and latency introduced by Windows' built-in audio systems.
