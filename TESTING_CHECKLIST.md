### Control Positioning
- [ ] Controls maintain relative positions during resize
- [ ] Status area expands/contracts with window width
- [ ] Button positioning remains logical during resize
- [ ] No controls become inaccessible or overlap

## 6. Error Handling ✓

### Input Validation
- [ ] Buffer size validation prevents values < 32 or > 8192
- [ ] Sample rate validation prevents values < 8000 or > 192000
- [ ] Clear error messages explain what values are acceptable
